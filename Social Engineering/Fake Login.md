# Fake Login
Many users use the same password when get registered on a sever, so with this method, we can steal the password of the login.
How it works?
We need to make a fake server, and then put a login plugin that save the passwords in plain text.
If you didnt found one, (because most of the login plugins puts the password on a hash), you can add a keylogger plugin, so you can get all comannds logs like /register /login !
When you have done the server, you need to use the social engineering to make the victim to register on your server.
And pum! You got the password.
This methods takes time, but is really effective, I got so many passwords from staff`s with this shit xD
