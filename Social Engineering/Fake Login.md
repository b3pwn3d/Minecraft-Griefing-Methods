# Fake Login
Many users use the same password when get registered on a sever.
So, with this method, we can steal her password.
How it works?
We need to create a server, and put a login plugin that save the passwords in plain text.
If you didn`t found one, (because most of the login plugins puts the password on a hash), you can add a keylogger plugin.
And once you have the server, you need to use the social engineering to make the victim to register on your server.
And pum! You got the password.
