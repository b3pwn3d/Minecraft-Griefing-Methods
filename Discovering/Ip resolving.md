# Ip resolve

First of all, you need to get the ip of the network/server before you perfom a scan.
For that, you can use this command on linux/windows:

`ping hypixel.net`

In this case, I am trying to get the hypixel ip.
But remember, avoid scanning the following types of ip`s, because they are protected:

- 104.* (Cloudfare)
- 81.* (tcp shield)
